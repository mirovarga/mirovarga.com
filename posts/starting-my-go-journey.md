## Trying Go for the First Time

I first heard about the [Go](http://golang.org) programming language several
months ago. I was curious how it was to code in it so I downloaded a free book
to learn more. But I was soon put off by the mere fact that some functions
started with uppercase letters (at that time I didn't know that it was on
purpose).

I'm not sure why I disliked it so much (and still do to some degree) but it was
enough for me to stop reading the book and forget about the whole thing.

## An Intermezzo

For a couple of months I've been getting a little frustrated about the whole
JavaScript thing. *In my humble opinion*, ES6 starts to complicate the language.
We now suddenly have both [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and
[io.js](https://iojs.org). There are new libraries and frameworks every week so
when you hardly learn one you can start with another.

## The Second Try

Thus frustrated, I remembered there was something like Go and I decided to give
it another try. But this time I started differently.

I first read the [FAQ](http://golang.org/doc/faq) and got quite interested. Then
I continued with the [tour](http://tour.golang.org/), moved to
[writing the code](http://golang.org/doc/code.html), then to
[effective coding](http://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) and I finished with
the [specification](http://golang.org/ref/spec). Of course, in addition to the
official documentation, I've read a lot about the real life experience with Go,
whether it has a future, how it performs and the like.

All in all, I think I've finally found another language that I want to truly
learn (after trying Python, Erlang and even Haskell but very soon losing
interest in each).
