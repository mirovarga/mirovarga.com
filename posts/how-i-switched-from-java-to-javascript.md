I know that there are lots of posts about why JavaScript, or more specifically
Node.js, is better than Java but nevertheless I wanted to contribute, too.

## The *Java only* Period

I was introduced to Java by a friend around 1997 or 1998. I liked the idea that
I could write a code once and run it everywhere without compiling it separately
for each platform.

But when I got to making web stuff I started to feel strange about Java. The
frameworks (or pure servlets at the time) seemed too complicated to achieve
just the simplest things.

At that time I knew that JavaScript existed but I considered it a toy language
(the truth being *I didn't understand it nor wanted to*) and refused to write
anything in it. When I had to use JavaScript I'd rather use Java frameworks like
[Wicket](https://wicket.apache.org/) or [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/)
that could completely hide it.

## The *embracing JavaScript* Period

Around 2012 I noticed that there was something like Node.js and I started to be
more interested in JavaScript. I saw what great things could be done with it
and how more quickly and efficiently than with Java.

At this time I finally decided to give JavaScript a good try and learn more than
just its basics. I also learned Node.js and that got me to REST APIs and
[single page application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)s,
both of which I like very much.

I gradually realized that I had transitioned to a full stack web developer and
that the web and JavaScript had become to me what Java was before (JavaScript
can now be run almost everywhere).

## The *JavaScript only* Period

I almost don't use Java at all now. For me, JavaScript is much better than Java
and I try to avoid it whenever I can.

One thing I really don't like about Java is that you almost *have* to use some
heavyweight framework like [Spring](http://spring.io/),
[Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/) or [Liferay](http://www.liferay.com/) so your
code looks credible. (Of course there are JavaScript frameworks that resemble
the Java enterprisiness, like [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) *in my humble
opinion*).

As JavaScript imposes almost no structure on the code I can start working from
scratch and iterate to a working program, like quickly
[testing](/building-an-event-store-in-node-js.html) interesting ideas and concepts.
And of course I don't need an IDE - a nice editor like
[Brackets](http://brackets.io/) is enough.

I also noticed that JavaScript (or better Node.js) performance and resource
consumption is better than Java's in most cases.

## Two Confessions at the End

1. Though I really like JavaScript I'm rather unhappy about some ES6 features
like [classes](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#classes) - they start to
resemble Java to me.

2. I quite like Java 8
[lambda expressions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html).
They remember me of JavaScript callbacks and bring fresh air to Java.
